      Link="">A movie collection is a way to combine two or more individual movies into a group of related, linked movies. You might find this useful, for example, if you are creating a video tutorial for your users and want one lesson (i.e., movie) to smoothly lead into the next.</Definition>

    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">When you create a new movie or collection, Mimic lets you use templates. A template is simply an existing movie or collection file. By basing your addition on a template, you are giving yourself a head start because the template already contains some settings or formatting for you. Mimic provides you with templates (called "factory templates"), so you do not need to worry about coming up with your own template. However, if you want, you can create your own templates and use them when you create new collections. You can also use templates for other elements, such as skins.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">A tool that you can use to store objects (shapes, callouts, lines, text) for future use. For example, if you are including buttons in some frames, chances are that you'll want to use the same look and feel for all of the buttons in your movie. Instead of creating new buttons from scratch each time or copying them from other frames, you can create an initial "model" button and then add it to a palette. Then, when you're ready to use a button in another frame, you can just drag your "model" button from the palette to the frame.</Definition>

Objects can be elements such as shapes, lines, cursors, buttons, or even other images. Each object is stored on its own "layer." This enables you to overlap objects and edit them individually.</Definition>

When you record a movie, cursors with movement trajectories may be added to frames automatically. You can also add cursors and trajectories to frames manually. When a cursor reaches the end of its trajectory, the default action is that the next frame in the movie is played. However, you can specify a different end action for the cursor if you wish.</Definition>

      Link="">When you record a movie, Mimic can capture any typing actions that you perform on screen. This typing is therefore animated in the movie output. In other words, each letter of the content is typed as the user watches it. Not only can these animated text boxes be added automatically when you record movies, but you can also add them manually when you edit the movie.</Definition>

      Link="">A series of related bitmap images (with objects, actions, and movement) called "frames" that are viewed in sequence. The final effect is a movie that shows a series of actions that you recorded or have added manually. After you record a movie, a .mimov file is created. If you generate output from that file, another file is created (depending on the output format you select); this is the movie file that end users watch. You can also create a movie collection, which is simply a group of related movies (such as a video tutorial).</Definition>
