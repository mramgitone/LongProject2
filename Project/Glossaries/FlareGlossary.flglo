      Link="">A feature that lets you add index keywords to the Index window pane more quickly than you could otherwise.

      <Term>Topic</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A chunk of information about a particular subject. Topics are the most important part of a project. Everything else is contained within  topics (e.g., hyperlinks, text, pictures) or points toward topics (e.g., table of contents, index, browse sequences). The very reason end users open a Help system is to find information, a little direction. They find that help within individual topics.</Definition>

      <Term>Table of contents</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A method that end users can use to find information easily in your output. A TOC in Flare works much like a TOC in a printed book. It provides an outline of contents in your Help system so that end users can easily and quickly navigate to the information they need. You create a table of contents (TOC), adding books, topic links, and links to external files in a structure that you think would be useful for the user. End users then browse through a TOC to find information. For print-based and EPUB output, you need to use the TOC Editor to create a TOC just as you would create one for online output. However, there is a fundamental difference. Performing this task for online output creates an actual TOC in the output, which people use to navigate from topic to topic. This is not the case for print-based output. Performing this task for print-based output lets you indicate which topics will be included in the output and in what order. In that sense, this TOC functions more as an outline for print-based output. Therefore, for print-based output, you can think of it as an "outline TOC." If you want to include a generated TOC in print-based output, you need to use a TOC proxy in a topic instead.</Definition>

    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">A way to change the look and feel of content directly so that the changes are applied only to that specific content (as opposed to applying the changes throughout your project via the use of styles). Many easy-to-use tools are provided for editing and formatting topics directly in the XML Editor to give them the look and feel you want, without having to know XML at all. Simply open the topic that you want to format, and use the tool that suits your needs best. This direct approach to formatting topics (sometimes called "inline" formatting) can be very attractive because it is quick and easy. However, it is recommended that you use style classes instead of local formatting whenever possible. Although local formatting is very convenient in the short-term, using style classes is much more efficient and can save you a great deal of time in the long-term.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">In Flare's XML Editor, the insertion point cursor knows when it is inside or outside of a tag. By default, the insertion point cursor in the XML Editor is a bracket. This bracket cursor faces right ([) or left (]), depending on whether it is inside a particular tag. For example, let's say you have written a sentence. At the end of the sentence you have typed the word "Close" in bold font, followed by a period in regular font. Now you want to add the word "button" immediately after the word "Close," but you do not want the word "button" to take on the bold font. You hover the cursor at the end of the word "Close." The bracket faces left (]), which tells you that if you were to begin typing at that location, the next text would also be bold. So you move the cursor slightly toward the right and the bracket cursor faces right ([), which tells you that the next text at this location would take on the regular font of the period. You click the mouse button and type the new text in regular font.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">A process that allows you to store your project files in a central location and determine which individuals have access to those files. By using a system where individuals must "check in" and "check out" files to edit them, you can ensure that there are no file conflicts when many individuals are working on the same project (multi-authoring teams). You can also revert back to earlier versions of source control files if necessary. Source control is even useful for single authors because it provides a means for maintaining a constant backup of all project files.</Definition>

You can also check in SharePoint files, but in that case you do not have a copy of the file locally.

The first option is that you can import the marker content as regular text (which is the default setting). The second option is that you can import the marker content as an XML fragment (e.g., the first part of a bold tag—&lt;b&gt;—content as a complete XML tag.

      <Term>Lock</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">You can lock areas within topics, such as paragraphs, so that they cannot be edited. You might take advantage of this feature, for example, when you are using Flare's topic review and contributions process. If you want a reviewer to see portions of a topic, but you do not want that individual to alter them, you can lock those parts. After the file is returned, you can unlock those areas of the file.</Definition>

      <Term>Report</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">There are a couple of basic kinds of reports in Flare.

First, there are Analyzer reports that can be created based on analysis scans of your project. These reports show various types of information that Analyzer captures from your project, such as broken links, topics not indexed, and more.

Second, there are error reports that you can save from error logs. These logs display when you generate a target that contains certain issues.

Both types of reports are stored in the Project\Reports folder of the project. Analyzer reports have an .flrep extension, and error reports have an .mclog extension.</Definition>

      <Term>Zip</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">If you want to send your project to another location or person, you can package (zip) the project into a single file that is much smaller than the entire project in its normal state. The zipped project can then be easily unzipped by anyone who also uses Flare, retuning the project to its normal state so that it can be edited. Zipping a project is also a great way to create and store a backup of your project.

There are two methods you can use—(1) zipping only or (2) zipping and emailing. The first method lets you zip the project and place the compressed file where you want on your computer. The second method lets you zip the project and immediately attach it to an email so that you can send it to someone.

Zipped files have an .flprjzip extension.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">Alternative sets of styles in a style sheet that authors use for different outputs. For example, the default style for a text hyperlink in Flare is blue with an underline. That is fine for the online outputs, but let's say you want this style to appear in black font with no underline for printed output. You can create a medium style (or use the one called "print") and set the hyperlink style class to black font with no underline. Then in the print target, you can specify to use the "print" medium type. When you build the output for the print target, all text hyperlinks will be black with no underline. Not only can mediums be used for stylesheets, but they can also be used in HTML5 skins to support responsive output.</Definition>

This architecture consists of a set of design principles for creating "information-typed" modules at a topic level and for using that content in various delivery modes. This allows you to more easily reuse information, thereby saving time and maintaining consistency in your documents. In Flare, you can import and export DITA file content.</Definition>

    <Definition
      Link="">Text that is "blacked out" in PDF or XPS output. This is much more efficient than attempting to black out text or images after the document has been printed. What is meant by "blacked out"? Redaction occurs when content is permanently eliminated from a printed or electronic document. In place of that content, end users will see black rectangles that indicate where the original content was found. When you use this feature, the text in the generated PDF or XPS output is truly gone. There is no way a user can peek into the PDF or XPS output and find it.</Definition>

If you import DITA files that already contain relationship tables, those tables are retained in Flare. You can also create new relationship tables in a project and insert proxies into individual topics. In online output, the end result is a link that let users quickly open related topics.</Definition>
