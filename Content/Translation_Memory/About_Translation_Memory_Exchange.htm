        <p>The purpose of Translation Memory eXchange (TMX) is to allow easier transmission of translation memory data between tools and/or translation vendors with little or no loss of critical data during the process. </p>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Products.Lingo" />, you can import TMX files from tools such as <MadCap:keyword term="SDL Trados" />Trados and <MadCap:keyword term="CATALYST" />CATALYST. This allows you to leverage all prior translations, whether or not they occurred in the same project or document. By importing a TMX file into <MadCap:variable name="Products.Lingo" />, all of your past translation work will become available as suggestions when you are localizing content in <MadCap:variable name="Products.Lingo" />. Then, when you have finished translating content in <MadCap:variable name="Products.Lingo" />, you can export the TMX files so that they can be used again in the other tools. </p>
