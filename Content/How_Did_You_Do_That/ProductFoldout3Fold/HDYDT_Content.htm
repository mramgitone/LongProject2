        <p>Adding your own content to the Product Foldout 3-Fold template is relatively simple. There are just a few things to keep in mind.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Layout Modes and Style Mediums </span>When you open a topic in the XML Editor, you may notice that there are different modes for viewing the layout. In addition, you can switch to different style mediums to show the content with the correct styles applied. Layout modes and medium selections can be seen in the local toolbar.</p>
                <p>So if you open the Front or Back topic and it looks nothing like the page layout or the end result, you likely need to switch to the appropriate layout and medium. For best results with this template, you should view topics using the <span class="Emphasis">Print Layout</span> mode with either the <span class="Emphasis">default</span> or <span class="Emphasis">print</span> medium. You can select these in the local toolbar of the XML Editor:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/LayoutAndMedium2.png" alt="" title="" />
                </p>
                <p>After you select these options, you should see the text on top of the page layout associated with it. Then you can simply replace the template text with your own content. </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Replacing Images </span>Although it's possible to insert images directly into a topic, the images in this template were added to the page layout, and in particular to the background of the layout. So you can open the page layout to replace the images with your own. Alternatively, you can remove the background images altogether and insert images directly into the topic. However, keep in mind that if you want images to straddle across panels in the foldout, you'll need to add the images as background in the layout. If you insert images directly in the topic, they will display only within the boundaries of the body frame or column where they've been inserted.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Need More Space? </span>You might find that you require more space to include all of the content that you want. In that case, you probably want to use one of the other Product Foldout templates that contains more panels (i.e., 4-Fold, 5-Fold, 6-Fold, 12-Fold).</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Adjusting Styles </span>If you remove the background images or replace them with others that are larger or smaller, you will probably need to adjust the styles (e.g., indentation, space above/below) so that text fits nicely around the images. See <MadCap:xref href="HDYDT_Styles.htm">How Did You Do That? Styles</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Variables </span>We used variables for the company name and the title of the foldout on the first panel. We also used them for company information (e.g., address) on the back of the foldout (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Variables/About_Variables.htm">About Variables</MadCap:xref>). Variables can be useful if you plan to use the same page layout for multiple outputs. For one target you can use the default definitions for the variables, and you can override the variable definitions for any of the other targets you might generate (see <MadCap:xref href="../../Variables/More_About_Variables/Overriding_Variable_Definitions.htm">Overriding Variable Definitions in Targets</MadCap:xref>).</li>
        </ul>
