        <p>Welcome to MadCap <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />—a unique application used for quickly transferring movie and frame properties from one MadCap Mimic movie to another. These properties can include objects (e.g., shapes, cursors, typing boxes), timing, sizes, and more.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> is especially useful when you are recording a new version of a movie where most of the frames are the same as those in the older version of the movie. It is designed to replace the manual work involved in copying or re-creating all of the various properties in each frame so that the new movie looks and behaves the same way as the older movie. </p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p class="ExampleHead">example</p>
                        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Let's say you have created a 75-frame movie that shows end users how to use your company's software application. In all of those frames you have spent hours adding objects such as callouts and buttons, placing actions on those objects, specifying precise timing for your cursor movements, and more. </p>
                        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Later, your company releases a new version of that software, and you must update your movie accordingly. Because the user interface of the software application has changed and there are a few new features that need to be included, you will need to completely re-record the movie. Suppose that when you are finished, the new movie is 96 frames long, and 71 of those frames are virtually the same as those in the old movie. </p>
                        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Now that you are finished with the recording task, you must make sure all of your objects, actions, timing, and other settings are in place. You could spend hours manually re-creating all of those properties, but instead you use MovieSync to do this automatically.</p>
                        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Therefore you open both the old and new movies in MovieSync. You align the frames so that they are partnered with their correct counterparts, and you use the Properties window pane to take a look at the exact properties that will be transferred. Because there are more frames in the new movie, there will be some frames that do not have matching frames. These are marked as "new frames."</p>
                        <p class="Example">Once the frames are aligned and you are satisfied with all of the properties listed in the Properties window pane, you click a button and copy all of the properties from the old movie to the new movie. Finally, you save the new movie so that you can open it in Mimic and continue work on it and generate output. Although there are some frames in the new movie for which you will need to provide properties, there are 71 frames that are already finished and only require testing.</p>
