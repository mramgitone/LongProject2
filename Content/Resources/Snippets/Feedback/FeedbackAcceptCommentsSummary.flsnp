        <p>If you set up MadCap Feedback so that new comments require approval before being added to the online output, those comments move to Pending status by default. Therefore, you must accept a comment before it is added to the online output to be viewed by everyone. Even after you accept a comment, you can later change your mind and assign a different status to it (Hidden, Pending Review) or discard it any time you want. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">(Use Feedback Explorer if you want to return a comment to the Pending Review status).</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
