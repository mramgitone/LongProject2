        <p>When you view list styles in the Stylesheet Editor, you will see custom formats displayed as classes under the respective &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; parent styles, depending on whether the first level of that format is an ordered or unordered list. However, these classes are really limited to the list style type for each.</p>
