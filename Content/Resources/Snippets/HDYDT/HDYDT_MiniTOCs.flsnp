        <p>Mini-TOCs are supported in both online and print-based outputs. In the Web Print Mobile template, we used mini-TOCs for two of our PDF outputs, but not for any of the other outputs. For those two PDFs, we created mini-TOCs on the first page of each chapter to show the contents of that chapter and the corresponding page numbers. The mini-TOCs are based on the lower-level headings in the rest of the chapter. We also used styles to control the look of the mini-TOCs.</p>
