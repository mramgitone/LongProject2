        <p>All of our online and PDF outputs are designed to include an index. Some of the steps for achieving this are the same for all outputs, but some are different. In the web and mobile outputs, the index displays as an alphabetical list of terms, and when you click them, topics associated with those words open. In the PDF outputs, the index displays toward the end of each manual, with terms listed alphabetically under letter headings and page numbers next to each term.</p>
