        <p class="Example">Let's say you create a Flare project and you are using Capture to produce images for it. You want to generate two different outputs from that Flare project. Let's say the first output is an online Help system to be placed on a website, and the other output is a PDF document, which you will send to a printer. Right away, you have a dilemma when it comes to the DPI (dots per inch) setting for the images in your project. The typical DPI setting for images displayed in an Internet browser is usually somewhere between 72 and 96. The DPI is automatically set for online output when you capture the image, depending on the computer that you are using. However, the DPI setting for printed output often needs to be higher (say, 300 DPI). Therefore, when you edit the image in Capture, you use the Format tab in the Image Properties dialog to specify the image settings for the online output (you may elect not to change any of the default settings). For print-based output, you use the Flare Print tab to specify the image settings; in the DPI field, you may want to select 300. In Flare, you insert the Capture image. When you generate output for the website (e.g., <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.WebHelp" />), Flare displays the image in the DPI used when you captured the image (e.g., 96 DPI). When you generate the PDF output from the project, Flare displays the same image in 300 DPI.</p>
