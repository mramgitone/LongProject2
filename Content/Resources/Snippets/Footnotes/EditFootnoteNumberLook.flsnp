        <p>You can change the look of the footnote numbers (both in-text and in-comment), by creating and modifying &lt;span&gt; style classes. Alternatively, you can use the &lt;MadCap|footnote&gt; style or a class of it to modify the look of both the in-text and in-comment footnote numbers. The difference is that the &lt;span&gt; style lets you change the look of one or the other, rather than both at the same time.</p>
