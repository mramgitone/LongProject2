        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">Let's say that you have your cursor on a regular paragraph and you want to apply a list &lt;li&gt; style to it in order to turn it into the beginning of a bulleted list. Because it is not yet a list item, but rather a simple paragraph, you will not see your &lt;li&gt; style when you try to select it. Instead, you will see several paragraph styles in the list. In order to use the list style, you first need to turn the paragraph into a bulleted list item, by clicking the bullet button <img src="../../Images/lists_btn_bullet_list.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the Home ribbon or Text Format toolbar.</p>
        <p class="ExampleMiddleSection">You also might notice that if you have your cursor in a list, you only see &lt;li&gt; styles in the window pane, but not the broader &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; styles. To see these other styles, click at the very beginning of a list item. Then press the left arrow key. This should switch the Style window pane from showing &lt;li&gt; styles to the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; tags. If you have your structure bars on, you'll see why this happens. When you initially click in a list, you'll see that the &lt;li&gt; block bar is highlighted, so <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> assumes you want to do something with that style level. After you press your left arrow key enough, you'll see the next level up (&lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;) become highlighted. And if you keep pressing the left arrow key, <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> will highlight then next level of style (e.g., &lt;body&gt;). And whatever is highlighted in the structure bar should become available as styles in the Style window pane.</p>
        <p class="Example">Here is another example. If multiple paragraphs are selected or if the cursor is simply placed somewhere within a paragraph, the <MadCap:keyword term="Styles:paragraph" />paragraph styles are shown in the Styles window pane. If only a portion of a paragraph is selected, the <MadCap:keyword term="Styles:character" />character styles are shown.</p>
