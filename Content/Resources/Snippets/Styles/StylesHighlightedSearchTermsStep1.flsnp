        <p>Create new classes to hold the style information for the search terms found in a topic. You can do this for the first 10 terms that users enter in the search field, naming each class "span.SearchHighlight1," "span.SearchHighlight2," and so on until you create "span.SearchHighlight10." The easiest way to create these classes is to import them from a <MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare" /> factory stylesheet, but you can also create them manually.</p>
