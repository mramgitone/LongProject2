        <p>Use a "See" link if the term in question does not exist in the project as an index marker. The idea is that, if a user looks for that term in the index, you want to point the person to a different term <i>instead of</i> the one originally sought. You can enter one "See" link per term.</p>
        <p>Use a "See Also" link if the term in question does exist as an index marker somewhere in the project. The idea is that, if a user looks for that term in the index, you want to point the person to a different term <i>in addition to</i> the one originally sought. You can create as many "See Also" links for a term as you like.</p>
        <p>Use a "Sort As" link if you want to sort an index keyword as something else.  This can be useful when a keyword begins with a symbol or an accented variety of a letter (e.g., place &lt;html&gt; in the "h" section, instead of at the top of the index).</p>
