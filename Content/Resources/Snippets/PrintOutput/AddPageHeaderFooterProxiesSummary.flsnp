        <p>The page header and footer proxies let you insert content or automatic <MadCap:keyword term="Page numbers:printed output;Print-based output:page numbers" />page numbering (specifically designated for the first page, even pages, or odd pages) in a master page. Use the page header proxy to insert content and page numbering above the body, and use the page footer proxy to insert content and page numbering below the body. When you insert one of these proxies, a page number placeholder is added automatically. You can delete it if you do not want to include a page number in that location, or you can realign it (to the left, right or, center).</p>
