        <p class="Example">Let's say you want to add a case study that is positioned next to the main body text on a page. Therefore, you insert a text box with a border and unique background color to make it stand out. You position the text box to the left of the body frame on a page. That way, it is clear to the reader that the case study is intended to provide additional information pertaining to the body text on that page.</p>
