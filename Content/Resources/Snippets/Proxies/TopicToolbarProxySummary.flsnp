    <body>The topic toolbar proxy is used to tell <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp"></MadCap:snippetText> where you want the topic toolbar to be displayed in the output. If you want the toolbar to be shown at the top of only a few topics, you can insert the proxy at the top of each of those topics. If you want the toolbar to be shown at the bottom of all topics in your output, you can insert the proxy into a master page to be used for that target. You can even insert the proxy in the middle of text in a topic if you want certain toolbar buttons to be displayed there. When inserting a topic toolbar, you can select an optional style class and you can choose which buttons to include in the toolbar.</body>
