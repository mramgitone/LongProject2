        <p>A proxy acts as a placeholder for the content that you have created elsewhere. When you generate output, the content takes the place of that proxy. Proxies can be added to regular topics<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare">, as well as to master pages</MadCap:conditionalText>.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> The difference is that a proxy added to a topic will display that information in the output only once (wherever the topic occurs), but if a proxy is added to a master page, the content will show up everywhere that the master page has been applied.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
