        <p>You can easily show or hide the grid on your image. Grids help you more accurately place images and objects on a frame. The grid does not display in the output, but is simply shown in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">Capture</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic">Frame</MadCap:conditionalText> Editor. By dragging and placing the edges of an object along those dots, you can be assured that the object is positioned more accurately and aligned with other objects and images in the frame.
