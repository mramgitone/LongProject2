        <p>Converts the cursor to Polygon mode, which lets you create a closed plane shape bounded by three or more line segments. After you select this button, you can click anywhere in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Capture">image</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic,Products.MovieSync">frame</MadCap:conditionalText> to identify the starting point for the shape. When you move the cursor, a straight line segment is drawn. If you click the left mouse button, it signifies the end of that line segment and the start of another line segment. When you move the cursor, another straight line segment is drawn. When you double-click, a final line segment joins your starting and ending points, thus closing off the shape. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Mimic,Products.Capture">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../UI_Elements/Polygon_Properties_Dialog.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Polygon Properties Dialog</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
