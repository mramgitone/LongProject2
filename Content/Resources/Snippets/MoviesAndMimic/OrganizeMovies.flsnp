        <p>You can include multiple movies in a <MadCap:variable name="Products.Mimic" /> collection. After you build the movie collection, you can view the output. The first movie listed in the Collection Editor plays first, followed by the other movies in order. If you create output in the MadCap Mimic Movie Format (MMF), the movies in the collection can be accessed from the drop-down list at the top of the MadCap Movie Viewer. If you create <MadCap:snippetText src="../Output/BrowserBasedOutput.flsnp" />, similar navigation is created based on the order of the movies in the Collection Editor.</p>
