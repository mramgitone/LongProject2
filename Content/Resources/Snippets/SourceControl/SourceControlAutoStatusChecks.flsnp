        <p>If you are using source control integration in <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp" />, you can check for frequent status changes automatically. You can specify the number of minutes and seconds when you want <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> to ping the source control repository and get status changes for files that have been checked out, checked in, moved, deleted, etc. The upside of this feature is that you can ensure that the source control status information is always up to date. The downside is that you may experience slower performance due to this constant communication over the network.</p>
