        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you import an <MadCap:keyword term="MP3 file" />MP3 file and try to edit it within Mimic, you need to have an MP3 codec on your computer. If Mimic finds that you do not have one, you will receive a message. This likely will not happen if you have <MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft Windows XP" />Windows XP because that operating system has a built-in MP3 codec. But if you have <MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft Windows Vista" />Windows Vista, you may encounter the problem. The solution is to install a third-party MP3 codec on your computer. Then close Mimic, reopen it, and try again.</p>
