        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you have linked to a Flare project, you cannot change the definitions for the variables from that project. However, you can change the definitions for variables that you create in Mimic. If you want to edit a variable from a Flare project, you need to do so from within Flare.</p>
