        <p class="note">In addition to selecting a file type from the list, you can type the file type extension in the field directly. This can be especially useful for file types not included in the drop-down. For example, if you want to look in all target files in the project, you can type <span class="TypedEntry">*.fltar</span> in the field. If you are searching for a file contained in the Project Organizer, also remember to select <span class="Emphasis">Find in source code</span>.</p>
