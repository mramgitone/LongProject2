        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Although this feature is called "expanding text," the content does not have to be strictly text only. For example, you can use an image for the hotspot. To do this, go through the normal process for creating expanding text. When you do this, just type some dummy text at the beginning where you want the image to be. The reason for this is that the Insert Expanding Text dialog lets you work only with text. After you create the expanding text effect, you'll see the two parts of the effect within brackets in the XML Editor. The hotspot is in the first set of brackets. Just click inside those brackets and replace the dummy text with the image you want to use.</p>
