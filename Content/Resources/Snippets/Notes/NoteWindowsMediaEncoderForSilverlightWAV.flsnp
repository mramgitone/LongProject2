        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you import a WAV file and generate Microsoft Silverlight output, you will be informed that Windows Media Encoder is necessary. By clicking Yes and moving through the wizard to install Windows Media Encoder, you are enabling Mimic to convert the WAV files to WMA format in the output. This results in a much smaller audio file. This is a one-time installation. You will see the message only the first time that you try to generate a Silverlight movie with a WAV file. If you click No when asked about installing the encoder, the WAV file will be skipped in the output.</p>
