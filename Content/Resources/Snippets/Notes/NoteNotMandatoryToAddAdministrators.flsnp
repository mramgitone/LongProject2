        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Snippets.Snippet1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">It is not mandatory that you add administrators. It is simply an activity that helps speed the process of accepting new comments and performing other tasks, because it notifies the appropriate individuals when action may need to be taken. Anyone who has Feedback Explorer installed with the appropriate Feedback license key will be able to take action, such as accepting pending comments, even if they are not added to the administrator notification list.</p>
