        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">If you click on a paragraph and press <span class="Emphasis"><MadCap:keyword term="Tabs" />Tab</span> or click <img src="../../Images/indent_items_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the Home ribbon or Text Format toolabar, you will notice that the paragraph is not indented, but rather the Create Group dialog opens. This occurs because <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> is encouraging you to engage in the "Best Practice" of using styles and <MadCap:keyword term="Groups (tags);Styles:tag groups" />creating tag groups, as opposed to using local formatting. A &lt;div&gt; tag is one of the tag groups that you can select. One common use of a &lt;div&gt; tag is to <MadCap:keyword term="Indent:div tag;DIV tag:indenting" />indent lots of content. For example, you might have a section of content containing four paragraphs, a numbered list, and an image. Rather than creating special style classes for all of those different elements with an indentation setting (e.g., margin-left or padding-left) on each, you can place your indentation setting on a class of the &lt;div&gt; tag. That way, any content contained within that &lt;div&gt; tag will be indented accordingly. It is recommended that you create classes of the &lt;div&gt; tag, rather than using the parent &lt;div&gt; tag itself. That's because the base &lt;div&gt; tag is also used for other features such as generated content from proxies, and you may want to keep the look of that generated content separate. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/More_About_Styles_and_Style_Sheets/Creating_Tag_Groups.htm">Creating Tag Groups</MadCap:xref>. </MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print">For more information about tag groups, see the online Help.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
