        <p>Responsive output is essentially "smart" output. When you generate HTML5 targets using a skin enabled with responsive output, the output display changes depending on the size of your browser or device you are using. So instead of seeing the entire HTML5 output on a tablet or smart phone, you will see a condensed look that is more appropriate for that device. You get the same effect if you shrink your browser to a smaller size.</p>
