        <p class="note">Translators must return a bundle in the same file format as the original bundle they received. If you sent the translator a Lingo Project File (*.LIPRJZIP), you will receive a Lingo Project File back from the translator. Likewise, if you sent the translator an XLIFF file (*.ZIP), they will send the completed bundle back as an XLIFF file.</p>
