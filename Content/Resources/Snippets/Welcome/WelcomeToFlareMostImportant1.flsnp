        <p>There are seemingly a gazillion things you can do in Flare. But you don't have to do them all. There are actually just a few concepts and features that are the most important to grasp. Don’t expect to be an expert at everything right away. Instead, begin by trying to wrap your brain around a few concepts and features that are most important when it comes to learning Flare. These concepts and features all tend to revolve around the idea of content reuse (or single-sourcing), which means that you can take the same content, re-use it, and produce multiple outputs from it.</p>
