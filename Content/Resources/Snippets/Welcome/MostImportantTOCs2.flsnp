        <p>You have the option to customize your TOCs in lots of ways, getting as fancy as you want. However, there are some things you should know. The most important thing to understand is that the TOC files that you see in the Project Organizer work differently for online output than they do for print-based output. For online outputs, TOC files are exactly as their name suggests; they are files that create TOCs in the output. But for print-based outputs, that same TOC file functions more like an outline. The element that actually generates a TOC in print-based output is called a "proxy." You can manually create that proxy yourself, or you can select an option in the Advanced tab of the Target Editor and let Flare do it all for you. There are pros and cons for both methods.</p>
