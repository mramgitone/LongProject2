        <p>Locate the border property that you want to change. Each side (bottom, left, right, top) has separate properties that you can set for the color, style, and width (e.g., border-bottom-style). You can set these properties individually, or you can set the main property for each side (e.g., border-bottom), which lets you specify the color, style, and width in one place. Even better, if you plan to have the same settings for all four sides, you can simply use the <span class="Emphasis">border</span> property to set the color, style, and width all the way around.</p>
