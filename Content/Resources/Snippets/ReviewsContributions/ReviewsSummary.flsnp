        <p>You can email review package files containing topics and/or snippets to other individuals for their feedback and/or changes. Alternatively, you can use SharePoint integration or the external resources feature to store the review package files. The reviewer's changes are always automatically tracked so you can see what edits were made. After inserting annotations (comments) or making changes to a file with <MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" /> or with <MadCap:variable name="Products.Contributor" /> (for non-<MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" /> users), reviewers can send the package back to you. You can then view those comments and accept or reject the edits so that they are added to the source file(s).</p>
