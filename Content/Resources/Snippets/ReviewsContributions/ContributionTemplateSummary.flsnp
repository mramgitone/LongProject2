        <p>In order to accommodate and assist the contribution process, you can create contribution templates for other individuals to use. These templates are topic files that can be crafted to already have certain pieces in place (e.g., text, formatting, locked regions) and make certain ancillary files available (e.g., variables, condition tags, stylesheets) to the contributor. After using the template to create a new document in <MadCap:variable name="Products.Contributor" />, the contributor can send it to you, and you can then make the document part of your project.</p>
