        <p>A master page is an element that you can create in your project in order to apply certain content to multiple topics. A master page is useful in online outputs, as well as print-based outputs. However, the benefits are somewhat different for online output than they are for print output. For example, you might use a master page in online output to apply features such as breadcrumbs, mini-TOCs, or footer text to multiple topics, or even all topics in a target. For print-based output, a master page allows you to determine page specifications (such as size or orientation) and to apply certain content (such as header text or page numbers) to many topics in a manual.</p>
