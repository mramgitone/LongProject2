        <p>Let's say you have used master pages in earlier versions of <MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" /> when creating Word or FrameMaker output, but now you decide to use the newer page layouts instead. You can manually remove all links to master pages in your target and table of contents. However, another alternative is to automatically disable the use of master pages in your project. By using this feature, <MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" /> will ignore all links to master pages when you generate the Word or FrameMaker target. It will instead use links that you provide to any page layouts.</p>
