        <p>Local formatting is a way to change the look and feel of content directly so that the changes are applied only to that specific content (as opposed to applying the changes<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare"> throughout your project</MadCap:conditionalText> via the use of styles). Many easy-to-use tools are provided for editing and formatting topics locally in the XML Editor to give them the look and feel you want, without having to know XML at all. Simply open the topic<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Products.Contributor"> or document</MadCap:conditionalText> that you want to format, and use the tool that suits your needs best.</p>
