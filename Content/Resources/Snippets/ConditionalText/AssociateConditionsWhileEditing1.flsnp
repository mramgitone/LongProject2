        <p>When editing a document in the XML Editor, you can click <img src="../../Images/conditions_btn3.png" alt="" class="ReduceButtonSize" /> in the local toolbar to open the Conditional Text dialog and include and exclude conditions on that file. This is similar to the feature that you can use to preview a document with certain conditions set. The difference is that this associates the conditions to the document as you edit it in the XML Editor.</p>
