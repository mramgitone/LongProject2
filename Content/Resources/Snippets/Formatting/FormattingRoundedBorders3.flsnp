        <p>This popup has two halves. you can complete only the left side of the popup if you like. This will create a curve that is equal horizontally and vertically. If you want a border to have more of a curve either horizontally or vertically, you can complete the fields in the right half of the popup as well, so that you have two values (e.g., 10px 15px) instead of one. For more information on using two sets of border-radius properties, see <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/" target="_blank">www.css3.info/preview/rounded-border/</a>.</p>
