        <p>The style is added to the <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp"></MadCap:snippetText> Style column. When you are finished importing the documents and the new <MadCap:snippetText src="../AllProductVariables.flsnp"></MadCap:snippetText> project is loaded, the content that had been associated with the FrameMaker style in the FrameMaker document will now be associated with a new style that has the appearance of the style that you mapped it to.</p>
        <p>What happens if you do not map a style? In the case of cross-reference styles, they are automatically added as style classes under the &lt;MadCap|xref&gt; tag. For example, let's say you import a style called "PageOnly" from your source document and do not map it to anything. In that case, it will be called "MadCap|xref.PageOnly" in the resulting project.</p>
