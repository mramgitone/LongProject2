    <body>There is a tab in the Skin Editor (for Standard and Mobile skins) called "Topic Toolbar." The fields in that tab mirror those in the WebHelp Toolbar tab (for Standard skins). As an alternative to specifying buttons in the toolbar proxy, you can specify them here in the skin. However, keep in mind that settings in the proxy take precedence over those in the skin.</body>
