        <p>After users enter comments, you can view them in Feedback Explorer. This can be done from the Comments window pane, which can be accessed by selecting <span class="Emphasis">View&gt;Comments</span>. Initially all comments are displayed. However, you can use the filter drop-down in the local toolbar to narrow which types of comments are shown (e.g., Accepted, Pending, Hidden).</p>
