        <p>When you finish translating all of the content in a project or file, you can export your work to the application, file, or location. For example, if you translated a Flare project, you can export your work out to a new Flare project; if you have translated a Word document, you can export your work out to a new Word document. The content developer can then open this translated project or file and create output for it.</p>
