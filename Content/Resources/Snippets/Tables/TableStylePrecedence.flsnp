        <p>Because you can often control the look of a table in multiple ways—(1) using local table properties, (2) using other local formatting tools, (3) a table stylesheet, or (4) a regular stylesheet—it's possible that you might encounter conflicting settings from time to time. When it comes to situations like this, the settings closest to the content typically has precedence. So any explicit setting in the Table Properties dialog (or other local formatting) has precedence over both stylesheet options, and the table stylesheet setting has precedence over the regular stylesheet setting. For example, let's say you open a regular stylesheet and specify that the outer borders of the table should be green. Then you open the table stylesheet and specify that the outer borders should be red. And then you open the Table Properties dialog and specify that the outer borders should be blue. You've told Flare to do three different things to the same table.  So in this case, the table would display blue borders, because the local properties rule over the other settings. But if you remove that setting from the Table Properties dialog and use the default setting, the table would then display red borders, because the table stylesheet has precedence over the regular stylesheet. And finally, if you remove the settings from both the Table Properties dialog and table stylesheet, using the default setting in both, the table would take its command from the regular stylesheet and display green borders.</p>
