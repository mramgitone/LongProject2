        <p>There are two modes that you can use when editing—Web Layout mode and Print Layout mode. These are necessary because Flare lets you create many different kinds of outputs from the same content, and online output is usually meant to look much different than print-based output. So how does the XML Editor know which way to display the content as you are editing it? Should it look like the web output that you intend to generate, or should it look like the PDF&#160;manual that you have in mind?</p>
        <p>This is where the Web and Print Layout modes come into play. They let you view your work in any number of ways for both online and print-based outputs. Coupled with a style medium and page layout settings, what you see in the XML Editor can vary greatly. If your content doesn't look the way you expect it to in the XML Editor, it likely has something to do with these settings. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">To understand these features, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Topics/About_Layout_Modes.htm">About Layout Modes</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="../../../Styles/Mediums/Selecting_Style_Sheet_Mediums.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Selecting Stylesheet Mediums</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../../../Page_Layouts/More_About_Page_Layouts/Selecting_a_Page_Layout_to_View_Content_in_the_XML_Editor.htm">Selecting a Page Layout to View Content in the XML Editor</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
