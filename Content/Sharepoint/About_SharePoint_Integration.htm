        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">SharePoint is like a scaled-down version of a source control tool, with the ability to check out and check in files. Many organizations use a source control tool to manage files that are part of products and will be shipped to customers, while using SharePoint mostly for internal files to be shared among colleagues. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">For more information see <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">www.sharepoint.microsoft.com</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

You can always email review packages to those individuals, but an alternative is to upload the review package to a SharePoint server. Each reviewer can check out the package, make their comments, and check the file back in. You can then bring the review package back into your project, integrating the updated topics into your project.</p>
                <p class="Example" MadCap:conditions="Products.Contributor">Let's say a Flare author needs you to review some of her topics. Rather than emailing you the files, the author places them on your company's SharePoint server. You can then check out that review package file, add comments or make changes to the files, and check the package file back in to SharePoint. The author can then bring the review package back into the Flare project, integrating the updated topics into the project.</p>

It all depends on how your company or team likes to work. If it is decided that individuals working on SharePoint files should check them out first, follow all three steps below.

                    <li><span class="SetOffFirstLevel"><MadCap:keyword term="Microsoft SharePoint:sychronize files;Microsoft SharePoint: map files" />(Option #2) Map/Open/Edit/Synchronize Copies of SharePoint Files</span>  After you connect to a SharePoint server, thus populating the SharePoint Explorer, you can open and edit any of the files in it. However, keep in mind that when you do this, you are editing the actual files existing on the SharePoint site. But there is an alternative. You have the option of copying any of the SharePoint files to your <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> project. That way you can edit copies of the files locally rather than working directly on the actual files located on the server. Following are the steps for using this method.<ol class="LowerAlpha"><li><p><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Copy and Map Files</span> <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">Read more… </MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody> You can right-click on any files in the SharePoint Explorer and copy them to your <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> project. When you do this, you can map the copied files in your project to the source files on the SharePoint server. See <MadCap:xref href="Copying_and_Mapping_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Copying and Mapping SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>. This is a different process than that of importing files, which you can do elsewhere in <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />. Files that are brought into a project using a traditional import process can be connected to the source file, but only in one direction (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the imported file in the project). On the other hand, files that are copied from the SharePoint Explorer can be connected via mappings to the source files in two directions (i.e., files can be updated from the source to the copied file or from the copied file to the source).</MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding></p></li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Manage Mappings</span> <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">Read more… </MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody> If you copy SharePoint files, you should create mappings (connections) between the copies of the files that you bring into your project and the source files on the SharePoint server. You can do this at the point that you copy those files into your project. You can also manage these mappings whenever necessary through the Map Files and Folders dialog. This involves the ability to create, change, or remove mappings. See <MadCap:xref href="Managing_Mappings_of_SharePoint_Files.htm">Managing Mappings of SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding></li><li><span class="SetOffSecondLevel">Open and Edit Files</span>&#160;<MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">Read more… </MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody>  You can open a copy of a SharePoint file from the Content Explorer by simply double-clicking it, just as you would open any other content file in <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />. If it is a file type not supported in <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />, you will be directed to open the file in its default application.

This process allows you to import content from SharePoint files, export content from mapped files in the project to SharePoint, or keep the most recently modified content (see <MadCap:xref href="Synchronizing_Sharepoint_Files.htm">Synchronizing SharePoint Files</MadCap:xref>). If you attempt to synchronize files and <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> detects a conflict (i.e., a mapped file has been modified both locally and in its mapped location), a dialog opens so that you can take the appropriate action (see <MadCap:xref href="../External_Resources/Merging_Mapped_Files.htm">Merging Mapped Files</MadCap:xref>).</MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding></li></ol></li>
