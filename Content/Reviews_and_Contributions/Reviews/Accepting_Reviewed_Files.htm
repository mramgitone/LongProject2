            <MadCap:keyword term="Reviews" />Accepting Reviewed Files</h1>
        <p>After an individual returns a package that you have sent them for review, you can bring that <MadCap:keyword term="FLTREV file" MadCap:conditions="Products.Flare" />FLTREV file into your <MadCap:variable name="Products.Flare" /> project. Once the reviewed files (i.e., topics and snippets) within that package are inside your project, you can view and accept them. After accepting a file, it is converted to an <MadCap:keyword term="HTM" />HTM file (just like your regular files) and overwrites the source file in your project. Any edits or annotations (comments) in the reviewed file therefore become part of the original file. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../About_Reviews_and_Contributions.htm">About  Reviews and Contributions</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

                    <li>In the local toolbar, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/accept_topic_btn.png" class="ReduceButtonSize" />. A message opens (if there are unresolved changes), indicating that the unresolved changes will be accepted if the file is accepted. However, if a conflict exists (e.g., the original file in your project changed since the time you sent it out for review), a dialog opens to let you know of the issue. You can then take the appropriate action; you can merge the changes from the files, keep the edits from the reviewer (undoing your changes), or keep your edits (discarding those from the reviewer).
