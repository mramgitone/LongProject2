        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> is different than <MadCap:variable name="Outputs.Frame" />, not just because it's a different product, but because <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> thinks about content differently than FrameMaker.</p>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">In FrameMaker, you use a book with files to define your content. The smallest chunk of information is typically the file, or chapter. You assemble a group of files into a book, which is your deliverable. You can use <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> the same way, in that you can open a topic and write a 50-page Chapter 4, but the real power of <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" /> will be missed.</p>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">In <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />, you don't work initially with chapters; rather, you work with topics. Similar to FrameMaker, you assemble the topics into the deliverable, but you will have many more topics than you had chapters in FrameMaker. </p>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">Topics are the unit of content that you should be working with in <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />. They are usually 2 to 4 pages of text, including any graphics. In most cases, topics will probably map to the headings (Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on) in your FrameMaker files. </p>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">Not all the information in every heading section should be a topic, though. For example, the information in your heading level 4s may not be able to stand on their own—this information may need the context of the information in the heading level 3 above it to make sense to the reader.</p>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">There are no hard and fast rules about the size of the chunks of information and how to break it up. In general, a topic should be able to stand on its own. This is where knowing the structure of your FrameMaker files is going to help you a lot.</p>
