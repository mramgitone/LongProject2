        <p MadCap:conditions="">One of the features of CSS that makes it much more powerful than other style systems is inheritance. This is simply the idea that elements in your document can inherit the style settings from other elements. This occurs when one style element is added within another element, therefore creating a parent-child relationship. The child inherits all of the style settings that the parent has, unless you override those settings on the child element. This can be a very powerful feature because it allows you to set properties on a parent element once rather than setting the same thing on all of its children elements.</p>

                <p MadCap:conditions="" class="ExampleMiddleSection">Let's say you want all of your block-level elements to use Arial as the font type. Rather than setting Arial on all of the various tags (h1, p, div, ul, li), you can set it on the &lt;body&gt; tag. That way, the setting will "trickle down" automatically to all of the child elements. </p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="" class="Example">After some time you might decide that you want to continue using Arial for all of those elements except the &lt;p&gt; tags. In that case, you can simply set the other font type on the &lt;p&gt; style. The rest of the elements will continue to use Arial.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="">What happens if a value is not set on the &lt;body&gt; tag in the stylesheet? In that case, the value is inherited from the element's setting in the end user's browser.</p>
