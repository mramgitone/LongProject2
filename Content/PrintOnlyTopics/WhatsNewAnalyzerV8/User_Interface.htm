        <h1>User Interface</h1>
        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">Several changes have been made to the user interface, including some general location changes of important window panes.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/ThisChapterDiscussesFollowing.flsnp" MadCap:conditions="AnalyzerGuides.AnalyzerWhatsNewGuide" />
        <h2>Location Changes of Window Panes</h2>
        <p>In previous versions, the Analyzer Summary window pane opened in the center of the user interface, listing all of the issues found in a grid. The File Issues Viewer also opened in the center. Meanwhile, all of the informative window panes were located on the left side of the interface. The locations of these window panes have switched. Now the Analyzer Summary and file issues panes now open on the left by default, while all informative window panes open in the center. This has been done because the informative window panes typically require more real estate to display all of the necessary information.</p>

        <h2>Character and Line Position in Internal Text Editor</h2>
        <p>The Internal Text Editor now shows the character and line position of your cursor. This is shown in the upper-right corner of the editor. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.OnlineLive">See <MadCap:xref href="../../UI_Elements/Internal_Text_Editor.htm">Internal Text Editor</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        </p>
        <h2>Preview Bars</h2>
        <p>A file Preview Bar has been added to some window panes in <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/AllProductVariables.flsnp" />, such as the File List window pane. When you click on a file, this bar shows an icon, as well as the name of the folder or file.</p>

        <h2>Word Count</h2>
        <p>When you open a file in the XML Editor, you will see the word count for that file in the bottom toolbar. If you highlight words in the file, this area shows you how many words are selected out of the total count. If a file contains snippets, the words from those snippets are not included in this word count, because those are separate files.</p>
